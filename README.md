Inspiration
Tackling the sustainability pillar, our team was inspired to create a web application whose goal is to spread awareness of the climbing death toll of koalas as a result of the devastating Australian wildfires.

What it does
This is an 8-bit video game where the objective is to catch the koalas before the touch the ground. Use your keyboard's left and right arrows to control the basket and catch the koalas from the wildfires! But, be careful because you only have three lives! Though you save koalas digitally, when you use up all three lives, you can learn more about how you can save koalas in reality through donating to global charities.

How we built it
Built with just plain Vanilla Javascript and a bunch of canvases!

Challenges we ran into
This is our very first hackathon as first year students so we struggled immensely! Also, implementing Git Version Control was a major challenge.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating an aesthetically pleasing website using flex box during a short duration. Efficiently working together to get our most viable product done with extra time. Most importantly, programming in a language we are not familiar in (Javascript) and making a full fledged game and functioning website.

What we learned
Enough Vanilla Javascript to create a simple web-based game

What's next for Objective Koala
Implementing Google App Engine, allowing us to save user accounts and keep score of each person's score of koalas saved. Potential for a leaderboard using Google Datastore
