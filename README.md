Inspiration:

Tackling the sustainability pillar, our team was inspired to create a web application whose goal is to spread awareness of the climbing death toll of koalas as a result of the devastating Australian wildfires.

What it does:

This is an 8-bit video game where the objective is to catch the koalas before the touch the ground. Use your keyboard's left and right arrows to control the basket and catch the koalas from the wildfires! But, be careful because you only have three lives! Though you save koalas digitally, when you use up all three lives, you can learn more about how you can save koalas in reality through donating to global charities.
